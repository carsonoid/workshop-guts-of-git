# Welcome!

Here is where I tell you what you will find in this repo

## What you need

* A relatively modern version of git
  * Older versions should work just fine but you may see `master` instead of `main` in many examples

## What you do **not** need

* A git server
* A GitHub or any other account

## Disclaimers

* Yes, this is basically a different verison of the [git docs](https://git-scm.com/docs) and [pro git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Both are excellent data sources, this is just less a comprehensive version of a subset of that information
* This workshop is full of example commands and outputs. The exact output may change depending on your `git` version but most of the concepts should stay the same.
