# Workshop: Guts of Git

This workshop has been created to help you dive deeper into how Git works.

## What the workshop will **not** cover

This is **not** a "from the ground up workshop". As such, it will not introduce you to basic `git` commands and their usage. Things that you will be expected to at least understand on a basic level are listed below.

* `git init`
* `git add`
* `git commit`
* `git push`

## What the workshop **will** cover

* How basic commands work internally. i.e. what they actually *do*
* A solid foundation above the basics
* A better understanding of branch strategies


## Tips

### Code blocks are click-to-copy

Commands you will run will show up in code blocks like this:

```bash
echo "you can click me to copy my contents"
```

Additionally, sample outputs often follow commands and are in a different style:

```txt
you can click me to copy my contents
```

### Some bonus information is hidden behind expandable sections

{{< details "Click me: I expand!" >}}
## You did it!

In the workshop this often represents side-notes or other non-essential information
{{< /details >}}
