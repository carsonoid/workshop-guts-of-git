# Why Do We Use Git? (Or any VCS?)

Git is a tool we use. Before we even start diving into how it works
we should understand what exactly it provides and why we use it

## Just for code backup?

If that's what you want. Just use 'cp' - It's faster, lighter, and simpler

## Just to share code?

Again there are plenty of ways to share files without Git:

* Dropbox
* GCS
* Email
* Slack
* Shared Drives

{{<                                                               page-break >}}
## Git is a **Version Control System**

We use it so we can have full control and history over our code. This means we want things like:

* Attribution  - Who did it?
* Diffs - What changed?
* History - When did this change?
* Metadata - Why (commit messages)?
* Flow control - Add changes, Revert Changes, Update to latest
* Conflict Resolution - Annoying, but absolutely essential
